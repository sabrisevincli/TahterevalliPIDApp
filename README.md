# TahterevalliPIDApp
A PID-based control system for balancing a seesaw platform.

# TahterevalliPIDApp

## 🎯 Project Objective  
This project demonstrates a real-time PID control system used to balance a seesaw platform (tahterevalli). The system stabilizes the platform using sensor feedback and PID logic.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO / STM32 / etc. (depends on your setup)
- HC04 Ultrasonik Sensör
- Servo motors
- Python / C# interface (if desktop app)
- Serial communication
- PID control algorithm

## 🔧 Working Principle  
The sensor reads the tilt angle of the seesaw. A PID algorithm processes the angle and sends control signals to the servo motors to keep the system balanced.

## 🖥️ App Features
- Real-time plotting of angle
- Adjustable PID coefficients (Kp, Ki, Kd)
- Start / Stop control
- Sensor calibration support
